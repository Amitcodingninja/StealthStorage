# StealthStorage

**StealthStorage** is a Java-based file encryption tool designed to hide and manage files securely. The application allows users to store files safely by hiding them and protecting them with an OTP-based authentication system. 

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login or signup with OTP verification sent to your email.
- **Hide Files**: Encrypt and hide files in your system, making them invisible to unauthorized users.
- **Unhide Files**: Restore previously hidden files easily with secure access.
- **File Management**: View, hide, or unhide files with a simple, intuitive interface.

## Tech Stack

- Java
- MySQL
- JavaMail API (for OTP sending)
- JDBC for database connections

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StealthStorage.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd StealthStorage
   ```

3. Set up your database (MySQL):
   - Create a database named `filehandler`.
   - Run the necessary SQL scripts to create the `users` and `files` tables.

4. Configure your SMTP settings:
   - Set up email configuration in the `SendOTPService.java` file (use your email service credentials).

5. Compile and run the project:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

## How to Use
